# Utopia
The weekly schedule is my first project using the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) Framework.

I have planned to keep working on it and make it a full-fledged scheduling web application. Feel free to contribute to the same if you have worked on Semantic UI or even if you are starting out and want to tinker around projects created with Semantic.

This serves as the online version of a friend's final project last semester for which the class was supposed to come up with something that they can imagine happening in their utopia.
This particular schedule is focused on exercise/eating habits that one should follow to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
